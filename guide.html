   <p class="p1">below you can read a step by step guide on how to use both the product and our website to </p>
  <div class="p1"><h3>Step 1: make sure the arduino is connected</h3>
        <p>Make sure the arduino is connected to a power source, whether these are batteries or your own laptop. We already downloaded
            the code on the arduino.
        </p>
    </br>
    <h3>Step 2: open the console monitor</h3>
        <p>In the arduino IDE you can look in the console monitor to see the sensor data values coming from your COM poort (make sure you have the right one!)</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Step 3: Put the soil moisture sensor in the soil of your plant</h3>
    <a href="https://ibb.co/1XGcM0W"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1XGcM0W/Whats-App-Image-2022-04-15-at-7-46-48-PM.jpg" alt="Whats-App-Image-2022-04-15-at-7-46-48-PM" border="0"></a>
        <p>The soil moisture sensor (see picture above) is the only sensor you need to move. 
            You need to put this sensor in the soil of your plant to measure the moisture.
            The temperature sensor and the air humidity sensor can both stay at the same place.
        </p>
    </br>
    <h3>Step 4: Put the data from the monitor in the predict form</h3>
        <p>When gathering your data its important you do this for at least 5 minutes
            so you are sure you have stable data points. For each sensor put the amount you saw 
            the most on your monitor in the form. The form can be found <a href="index.html">here</a>.
        </p>
    </br>
    <h3>Step 5: Predict and take care of your plants!</h3>
        <p>Once you filled out the form please click on the sumbit button. This will tell you
           if your plant needs water or not. You can use the website to make predictions for as many
           plants as you want! If you have any more questions please visit the <a href="about.html">About</a> for our contact information
